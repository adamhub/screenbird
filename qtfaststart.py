    Quicktime/MP4 Fast Start
    ------------------------
    Enable streaming and pseudo-streaming of Quicktime and MP4 files by
    moving metadata and offset information to the front of the file.
    
    This program is based on qt-faststart.c from the ffmpeg project, which is
    released into the public domain, as well as ISO 14496-12:2005 (the official
    spec for MP4), which can be obtained from the ISO or found online.
    
    The goals of this project are to run anywhere without compilation (in
    particular, many Windows and Mac OS X users have trouble getting
    qt-faststart.c compiled), to run about as fast as the C version, to be more
    user friendly, and to use less actual lines of code doing so.
    
    Features
    --------
    
        * Works everywhere Python can be installed
        * Handles both 32-bit (stco) and 64-bit (co64) atoms
        * Handles any file where the mdat atom is before the moov atom
        * Preserves the order of other atoms
        * Can replace the original file (if given no output file)
    
    Usage
    -----
    See `qt-faststart.py --help` for more info! If outfile is not present then
    the infile is overwritten.
    
        $ qtfaststart.py infile [outfile]
    
    History
    -------
     * 2010-02-21: Add support for final mdat atom with zero size, patch by
                   Dmitry Simakov <basilio AT j-vista DOT ru>, version bump
                   to 1.4.
     * 2009-11-05: Add --sample option. Version bump to 1.3.
     * 2009-03-13: Update to be more library-friendly by using logging module,
                   rename fast_start => process, version bump to 1.2
     * 2008-10-04: Bug fixes, support multiple atoms of the same type, 
                   version bump to 1.1
     * 2008-09-02: Initial release
